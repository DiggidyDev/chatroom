# chatroom and games with friends (without ads) :)

## The aim
My aim is to create a fun solution to the awfully lonely lockdown situation that we've all had to face (in case something similar happens again, hint hint).
Hopefully it will allow us to communicate with eachother in dire times and express our shared love for gaming and making the most of our spare time - enjoying it with one another.

## Objectives

0.  Create a fully-functioning chatroom with mini-games to play with friends!

1. Fully-functioning chatroom(s):
    - GUI
    - Friend requests
    - Online users
      - Nicknames (session-specific and permanent IDs)
    - Messaging
      - Direct
      - Groupchat (invite only)
      - Gamerooms
        - Commands 
          - Vote skip
          - End match
          - Kick user
          - Marry/kiss/kill user
            - Marrying results in merged names
        - GIFs (MAYBE)

2. Games:
    - Games:
      - Graph traversal - Eulerian paths and cycles
      - Tic-tac-toe - AI (hints?)
      - Connect-4 - AI (hints?)
      - Hangman
    - Chatrooms for each game session
    - Invite-only games (send codes to friends and groupchats)

3. Server-side:
      - Users that sent the message see `You` instead of their nickname
    
4. Client-side:
    - Choose nickname
    - See friends (current activity? Set status)
    - Set current status (idle, online)
